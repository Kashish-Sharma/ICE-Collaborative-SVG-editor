## Getting started
* Paste your `serviceAccount.json` file in root directory.
* Clone the repo.
* <code>npm install </code>

## Create
We provide some basic shapes to create and use out-of-the-box like:<br>
* Rectangle
* Ellipse
* Triangle
* Star
* Regular Polygon
## Editing
* **Transformation**<br>
  Basic scaling and rotation is possible for each object using control points that can be moved with mouse control
* **Translation**<br>
    Any object can easily be selected and moved by clicking and dragging it with the mouse.
* **Arrangement**<br>
  The right-click menu allows the user to manipulate the arrangements of the objects (Bring-To-Front, Send-Backward)
* **Offline**<br>
  All our code uses installable JavaScript libraries that are easily install with npm install. This allows the editor to run completely offline after start-up.
* As of yet, you still need an internet connection to connect to a project, but we intend to provide a truly offline mode soon
## Commits
* Whenever you sync the project (vector), a new commit is created. Each commit is easily displayed allowing you to see and visualise the development process.
* It will soon also allow you to revert to some stage.
## Realtime Sync
When connected online, all commits are synced with the server which in turn informs all other connected users and syncs up with them.
